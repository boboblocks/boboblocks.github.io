## what's boboblocks?????
boboblocks is a scratch-like programming site built on [blockly.](https://github.com/google/blockly) 

boboblocks is meant to be used by javascript dummies to create [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) games without having much knowledge of javascript.

it can also be a way to make kaboom games faster for people that are experienced in kaboom.js.

raw code blocks are also included to add functions or other code you may need in your game that is not already represented by a block.

## who's bobo?
bobo is the cute little fish in kaboom's sprite library
